# MobileHacking--ProdigyHacking
Me and my team hack accounts for players of Prodigy Math Game that only have access to a mobile device/people who can't hack themselves.

Currently, manually hacking Prodigy Math Game on mobile devices is not possible to do manually, which is why I have created this station. All hacked accounts are made using hacks created by ProdigyMathGameHacking.

An order of any amounts of accounts are FREE.
The ProdigyMathGameHacking Code of Conduct does apply.

Our motiviation is the same as ProdigyMathGameHacking:

We're not trying to break the game because we're evil. We just wanted to help Prodigy become more secure, but they've ignored our emails and our requests to talk.

Because of that we're just publicly showing hacks! That, and it's also just fun ;)

All of our hacks are open source, and free. No paywalls, no ads, and no Patreon.

If you have any questions, email calebthehufflepuff@gmail.com - if you'd like to make an order, go to this page, https://github.com/CRobbins0867/MobileHacking--ProdigyHacking/issues/new/choose, and choose "Account Request" as the template.
